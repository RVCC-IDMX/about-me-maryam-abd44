            <h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>  
            
            <div>

                <p>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</p>
            
                <p>I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.</p>
                
                <p>On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."</p>
                
                <p>Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"</p>
                
                <p>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."</p>
                
                <p>My dear Holmes!"</p>

    <p>
        What is CSS Animations? CSS Animation is animations you could using CSS rather than using JavaScript. 
        CSS animation isn't just one property, but instead it has a lot of properties that could be used to make 
        websites look cooler. Some of the properties are @keyframes, animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, 
        and many more. @keyframes are inserted in a lot of different CSS, which means it can be reused.
         Next is animation-name, this property is used with @keyframes, it gives a specific name for it. 
         The next property is animation-duration, is when telling the code, a specific time when the animation needs to be stopped.  
         Furthermore, animation-delay is used when you want to tell the code to start the certain animation later. There are so many 
         things you could of with CSS animation that someone can create.</p>
    <p>
        I decided to make an animated circle that moves across the screen. At first, it was hard trying to understand how all these 
        properties work. With many mistakes made I made, I didn’t stop even though it got frustrating. When I started to understand how they 
        work, it got really fun because there is so much that someone could do. Below is going to be the tutorial how to make this animation showing below.
