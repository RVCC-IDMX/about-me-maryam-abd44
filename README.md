# All About Me Project 
Maryam Abdulwahab


This class has been a great course! I found out that I actually enjoy coding especially HTML and CSS. Some skills I learned in this class is how to embed videos, also how to make a contact form. It was easier than I thought. One thing I had trouble with is the images, itâ€™s hard to get the right size, especially when it comes to trying to make it responsive. Also, learned how to use CSS animation. Even if it was hard at first, I managed and started to get how it works. The colors I used were: #F0F0F0; and #02558B;. I chose this because I feel like it fit well together. I also like how it got the same level of brightness and darkness.
For licenses I dont mind if someone uses this and try to get ideas from it.
